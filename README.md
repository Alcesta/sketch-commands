# Sketch Commands

This will (eventually) be a port of my [Orange Commands](http://orangecommands.com) for Bohemian Codingâ€™s [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

You will need the latest [Sketch beta](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/) to use the commands (not really, but that's what I'm using).

If you are curious about scripting Sketch, here's a link to the official [Sketch Scripting API documentation](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/scripting/).


## Thanks

Huge props to Bohemian Coding (and specially Pieter Omvlee) for their collaboration on making the scripting API a reality.
