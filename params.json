{"name":"Sketch Commands","tagline":"A collection of script commands for Bohemian Coding’s Sketch.app","body":"# Sketch Commands\r\n\r\nThis will (eventually) be a port of my [Orange Commands](http://orangecommands.com) for Bohemian Coding’s [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. You'll need at least version 2.1, and you have to **enable scripting in preferences**:\r\n\r\n    ![](library/README-01.png)\r\n\r\n    Beware, though: I like to use the latest [Sketch beta](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/) for development, so some things might not work as expected.\r\n\r\n2. [Download the ZIP file with the commands](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/archive/master.zip)\r\n3. Copy the contents of the ZIP to `~/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins` (you can get access to that folder by opening the Plugins menu, choosing \"Custom Script...\" and then clicking in the gear icon and choosing \"Open Plugins Folder\")\r\n\r\n    ![](library/README-02.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## More info\r\n\r\nIf you are curious about scripting Sketch, here's a link to the official [Sketch Scripting API documentation](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/scripting/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nHuge props to Bohemian Coding (and specially Pieter Omvlee) for their collaboration on making the scripting API a reality.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2013-2014 Ale Muñoz\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
